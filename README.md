### Hi there 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently actively working on [Sequana](https://sequana.readethedocs.io) and also maintaining [BioServices](https://bioservices.readthedocs.io), Damona, Fitter, colormap, spectrum, Bioconvert and easydev.
- I'm currently leading the bioinformatics and data management activities of the  Biomics NGS platform (biomics.pasteur.fr) building pipelines and tools for production.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on BioConvert, BioServices and Damona and of course Sequana. Would you be interested to take the lead on Spectrum, fitter, colormap, please let me know.
